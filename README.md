# myVirtualSensorpad

A very simple webinterface to simulate sensors and promote their values via MQTT. Used it for lab sessions in the area of IoT and Digital Twins.

upload the files to a server of your choice and browse to the path, have fun and alter it to your liking. Happy about anyone who wants to work on this in a fork or contribute to this projekt.
